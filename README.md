Triangular Calculator by Ryland Sacker.
This program uses camth functions and Trigonometric identities to calculate the sides of a right triangle.
The code can be run from either the .exe or by compiling the source code.
You will be prompted to enter up to three sides of the triangle and up to two angles since the right angle is predecided.
The remaining values will then be calculated and printed to the screen.
Enjoy!
When dissasembling different parts of the program using netrun, the cmath functions all are just calls to an external library so there isn't an increase in simplicity of is there any understanding to be gained from it sadly. I was hoping to write at least one of the functions in assembly, but there's no real benifit to it.
